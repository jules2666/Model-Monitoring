# Flight Delay Data Drift Report

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing **data drift** in the `DelayedFlights.csv` dataset, available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Airline Delay Causes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)

The analysis is performed using the **Evidently AI** library.

## ðŸ§ª Project Steps

1. **Load and clean** the `DelayedFlights.csv` dataset  
2. **Select relevant features**: arrival delays, departure delays, and specific delay causes  
3. **Simulate two datasets**: reference and current  
4. **Generate a data drift report** using `Evidently`  
5. **Export the report** as an HTML file: `delayed_flights_drift_report.html`
